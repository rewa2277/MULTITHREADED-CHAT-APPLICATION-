This project implements a console-based Multithreaded Chat Application using core Java networking and concurrency concepts to demonstrate real-time client–server communication over a TCP/IP network. The application is built using Java Sockets (ServerSocket and Socket) for establishing reliable connections between a central server and multiple clients, and Java Multithreading to ensure that each connected client is handled independently without blocking the server or other users. The server continuously listens for incoming client connections on a specified port and, upon accepting a connection, spawns a dedicated thread for each client to manage message reception and transmission concurrently. This multithreaded design enables multiple users to communicate simultaneously in real time, making the system scalable and responsive even when several clients are active at the same time. Messages sent by any client are broadcast to all other connected clients, demonstrating a simple publish–subscribe communication model commonly used in chat systems and collaborative applications. The project emphasizes the practical implementation of core networking concepts such as socket creation, stream-based input/output, connection lifecycle management, and graceful client disconnection handling. It also highlights important concurrency concepts including thread creation, synchronization of shared resources (such as the list of connected clients), and safe handling of client sessions in a multi-user environment. The application is intentionally kept lightweight and free from external libraries to provide a clear understanding of how low-level network communication works in Java, making it ideal for academic purposes, laboratory assignments, and beginners learning distributed systems, client–server architecture, and network programming fundamentals. This project serves as a foundational model for building more advanced communication systems such as group chat platforms, real-time collaboration tools, messaging servers, and online multiplayer applications, and it can be further extended with features like user authentication, private messaging, chat rooms, message persistence, logging, encryption, and graphical user interfaces. Overall, the Multithreaded Chat Application demonstrates how reliable network communication and concurrent processing can be combined in Java to create a functional, real-time, multi-user system, providing hands-on experience with essential concepts used in modern distributed and networked software systems.
